                My name is Subhash Singh and I am from Uttarakhand (India). I
                have done B.Sc from Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal
                University(HNBGU) mathematics as a main subject. My interest in
                mathematics has been a driving force behind my pursuit of a
                career in data science. When I hear the data science word first
                time I was not very interested as first but when I search about
                it I was fascinated by the power of data and how it could be
                harnessed to make informative decisions, solve complex problems,
                and drive business success. Artificial Intelligence also being
                discussed in my friend circle that increase my interest in this
                field. I want to see myself as a good Data Scientist. As a new
                to Data Science and Data Analytics, I am eager to contribute my
                skills and knowledge to make an impact in the industry. Being a
                fresher, I bring a fresh perspective and a strong drive to learn
                and grow. I am eager to delve deeper into areas such as machine
                learning, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence to
                further enhance my skills and contribute to data-driven
                solutions. I am open to opportunities that allow me to apply my
                knowledge and skills in data science and data analytics. Whether
                it's collaborating on projects, participating in internships, or
                joining a dynamic team, I am ready to contribute and learn from
                experienced professionals in the field. <br />
                Apart from my data science things I like travelling, listenning
                music, watching movies specially of science fictions. I am very
                excited that when I will got opportunity to travel in Himalayas.
